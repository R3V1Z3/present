Simply enter a Gist ID and click Present. A page will open displaying the Gist's Markdown content rendered as a presentation using impress.js.

More details about the parameters below.

## Gist

Add a Gist ID parameter to view that Gist's code:
https://ugotsta.github.io/present/?gist=d9d2cd4cdabd1f89c6d6

The Gist ID is simply the ID provided in the url of a Gist repository. The above ID, for example, is seen in the url of the original repository here: https://gist.github.com/uilian/d9d2cd4cdabd1f89c6d6

Just copy the ID portion to use it with Code Glorify.

## CSS

For themeing and further customization purposes, present can accept external CSS through a Gist file. Simply provide a Gist ID for the CSS code you wish to use and the app will inject it after loading up.

Completely change the style using custom CSS like so:
